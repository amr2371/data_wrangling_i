```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load in the FAS Litters Data
```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)
```

## `select`
Choose some columns and not others.
```{r}
select(litters_df, group, litter_number)
```

```{r}
select(litters_df, group, gd0_weight:gd_of_birth)
```

```{r}
select(litters_df, -litter_number)
```

Renaming columns...
```{r}
select(litters_df, GROUP=group, LITTer_NuMBer=litter_number) #Renames columns and only shows those
```

```{r}
rename(litters_df,GROUP=group, LITTer_NuMBer=litter_number) #Keeps all columns but just renames specific ones
```

Select helpers
```{r}
select(litters_df, starts_with("gd"))
```


```{r}
select(litters_df, litter_number, everything()) #the first one is selected and then they list everything else after so it helps with re-ordering.
```


```{r}
relocate(litters_df, litter_number)
```
